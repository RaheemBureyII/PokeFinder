# PokeFinder


I used PokeFinder, a Flutter app, to learn about GetX by implementing state management, navigation, and data retrieval functionalities. Through building this app, I gained hands-on experience with GetX's reactive approach and seamless navigation capabilities, empowering me to incorporate it into my future Flutter projects
